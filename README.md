# adyen-api
Adyen api experimentation created with speed and quantity over quality. Do not use in any serious way

## The api
The API folder contains a node express app with endpoints to serve the frontend. See ./api/README.md for instructions on how to run

## The frontend
The frontend folder contains a basic React SPA to play around with the API, almost serving like a POSTMAN sort of thing but made to experience the 'merchant point of view' that merchants experience during implementation.
